###  Dataset Description
   
Existing deepfake datasets like DeepfakeDetection and FaceForensics++ have advanced detection research but are limited by constrained real videos featuring a few actors and fake videos generated using popular software. As a result, detectors trained on these datasets often struggle with the diversity of real-world deepfakes found online.

To address this, we introduce **WildDeepfake**, a dataset of **7,314** face sequences from **707** deepfake videos sourced entirely from the internet. Despite its small size, WildDeepfake better represents the challenges of real-world detection, where baseline detectors show significantly reduced performance.

To enhance detection, we also propose **Attention-based Deepfake Detection Networks (ADDNets)**, utilizing 2D and 3D attention mechanisms to improve focus on real/fake facial features.

In each tar.gz file, there will be several folders containing face images, and the images in each folder represent a face sequence.
The image name in the folder represents the frame number it appears in the original video.

### Our ADDNet-2D Detection Method
<p align="center">
<img src="./ADDNet.png"  alt="ADDNet" title="ADDNet" align="center"></img>
</p>   
   The network structure of our proposed ADDNet-2D is illustrated below. Detailed structures of the three residual blocks used in our ADDNet-2D network are shown below too. These three blocks are also the building blocks of XceptionNet. The base network before the "resblock3" is our proposed ADDblock. Our ADDNet-3D shares the same ADD block architecture as ADDNet-2D, but has one ADD block for each of the face images in the sequence. Therefore, in our setting with face sequence length ùêø, ADDNet-3D will have ùêø ADDblocks, and each ADD blocks share the same weights. Also different from ADDNet-2D, the classifier network(structure after the ADDblock) of ADDNet-3D is a 3D CNN.

### Expriments
First, we use pre-trained [Resnet-101](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim) to extract features from the images in previous datasets and our dataset. Then we use the [T-SNE](http://projector.tensorflow.org/) to reduce the dimensionality. Red points represent fake faces, green points represent real faces. Here is the comparison:
